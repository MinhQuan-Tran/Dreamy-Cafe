            "A <b>cappuccino</b> is the perfect balance of espresso, steamed
            milk and foam. This coffee is all about the structure and the even
            splitting of all elements into equal thirds. An expertly made
            cappuccino should be rich, but not acidic and have a mildly sweet
            flavouring from the milk. And, because the milk is not actually
            mixed in it gives the espresso a stronger flavour." -

            "<b>Drip coffee</b> is made by pouring boiling water over ground
            coffee (the grind of which being much coarser than espresso). A
            filter that is typically made from paper separates the grounds from
            the brewed liquid which allows the water to pass through and fall
            into a pot or jug. However, you can now also get coffee pots which
            are especially for drip coffee brewing or electric options which you
            can set timers on so you can choose what time it's made." -

            "When making an <b>Irish coffee</b>, it's important to ensure the
            coffee is strong and the whiskey is Irish, as it's simply not an
            Irish coffee if you use Scotch whiskey. The coffee drink is drunk
            through its creamy head. To ensure the cream floats on top of the
            coffee and doesn't sink, you can whip or blend the cream before
            layering it on top of the coffee with a spoon. Learn how to make an
            Irish coffee here." -
